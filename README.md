# QuestOfTruth
***It would be nice if you can play the game first, as the following content contains details of the game and may spoil your experience***

The game The quest of truth tells about a little girl searching for the moon with a bead in her hand (a metaphor for a scientist's search for truth through theory/experiments). Along the way the little girl runs into four prophets representing four different views of science throughout history (from objectivism to subjectivism). I have a special design for the game where its ending can be connected to the start of another round. It represents how scientists pass knowledge to the next generations and how the fantastic journey of quest can start over again.
